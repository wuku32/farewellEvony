# 1. Farewell

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
1. I used to love this game so much that I became addicted to open boxes, stayed up all night to join rallies from big players to achieve a small thing;
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
2. I used to make a lot of friends in this game, they were the ones I chased or cared for, but now they have all left me. CoURagE is not my name, she was the R5 of my first alliance FoM. Me my name is wuku32;
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
3. Yesterday I spent money in this game for the first time. At first I was happy for successfully rescuing the dead troops, but after that I realized that it was very dangerous. For me, there are only zero times and countless times to spend money. A year ago, my college classmate in real life saw that I was so addicted to this game and advised me that I should either spend money to become the strongest player or not spend a penny, enjoyment is for the rich. . . So I decided not to spend a penny on Evony from then on, but now, I have gone against my heart.
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
4. I decided to quit this game. . . I know it is difficult for me as an addict, and it is difficult for me who has established connections with so many players, but I have to do it. I believe that with my self-control I will eventually calm down.
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
5. I am willing to transfer this account (and farm) to a player I care about for free, so that I will not let down the energy I have put in the past year.
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
6. If no one takes over this account, I will delete this account (and farm) in 3 days (before the time consumption activity starts). Before deleting it, I hope to leave the resources to a few friends I care about. . . I know that attacking player without alliance is legal, but please give me the last respect this time.
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
7. Recalling the past always makes me burst into tears. Thank you, whether you are my friends or competitors, without your en`COURAGE`ment, there would be no decent me now. Maybe the most regrettable thing about me in this game is that I have never been in the best alliance, lol.

# 2. How to AUTO set rallies

I dare not say that I am the first person to discover this in this game, but I should be the first person on server 1373
to discover that it is ***feasible to fully automate*** the holding of rallies. Before leaving, I hope to share this
secret with players in need to make your gaming experience easier. The tools you need first are as follows:

| Tool             | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [BlueStacks 5](https://www.bluestacks.com/bluestacks-5.html) | Fastest & Lightest Android App Player for PC                      |
| [iScout](https://www.iscout.club/en/dashboard)       | Monsters guide and assistant for PvP and SvS                      |
| [ESB-TKR v3](https://www.emulatorautomation.com/Home/Download)   | Evony Bot ESB-TKR. Join Rallies, Farm, Auto Set Bosses, and more! |

I know that once this secret is made public, it will cause many ethical issues in the future. I can only make a few
suggestions:

1. Do not share this tutorial with people you have not established trust with;
2. When setting the search parameters, the hunting radius ***should not exceed 250km*** to avoid affecting other
   alliances' hunting;
3. If it is unavoidable to affect other alliances, then move the alliance city to another location. The specific location may require some mathematical calculations.

## 2.1 BlueStacks 5

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
1. Download Evony APP (required)
</td></tr></table>

</td></tr></table>

![img_2.png](img/img_2.png)

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">

</td></tr></table>

As shown in the figure, the port of this instance is ***5555***

## 2.2 iScout

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
Once you use iScout, it means you have to spend money and choose Mechanist to unlock iScout's coordinate API service.
</td></tr></table>

![img_7.png](img/img_7.png)

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
You can set up some fixed search presets for easy reuse, just like you will set up presets for troops in Evony.
</td></tr></table>

Notice that I have mosaiced a place. This is the ***API key***, which is the KEY of automatically holding rallies.

## 2.3 ESB-TKR v3

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
You will get a 3-day free trial at the beginning, so now is not the time to worry about your wallet, you should focus on setting up the Collective and Dashboard.
</td></tr></table>

![img_4.png](img/img_4.png)

### 2.3.1 Setting up Collective

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
1. Generate Boss/Farm/Entity Key
</td></tr></table>

![img_5.png](img/img_5.png)

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
3. View -> Associate Keys. Bind the generated Boss key to the API key. After then, click Connect.
</td></tr></table>

</td></tr></table>

![img_11.png](img/img_11.png)

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
5. I have specifically marked the boss priority, which will determine which monsters will be rallied first. This is something you can optimize later.
</td></tr></table>

### 2.3.2 Setting up DashBoard

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
3. The preset here refers to the `Rally Spot preset` in Evony. If your preset is for monsters, just select `Use Preset March`; if not, I recommend selecting `Use Preset and Input Troop Amount`
</td></tr></table>

![img_16.png](img/img_16.png)

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
4. If you selected `Use Preset and Input Troop Amount` in the previous step, you will need to select the type and tier of troops.
</td></tr></table>

![img_17.png](img/img_17.png)

<table><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">
5. After many attempts, I found that setting it to `1` is the best
</td></tr></table>
